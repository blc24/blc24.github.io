New Zeno cases purport to show how an infinite number of agents can seemingly bring about some surprising effects merely by having the right intentions or dispositions. A growing literature has used these cases to argue for some substantive philosophical conclusions about (inter alia) infinity, motion, causation, ability, the laws of physics, and the logic of counterfactuals. In this talk, I will explain why these conclusions are unwarranted focusing in particular on the latter application.
